# Login and Registration System with JavaScript and LocalStorage

## Overview

This project is a simple Login and Registration system built using JavaScript and LocalStorage.

## Features

- **User Login**: Enables users to log in using their registered credentials.
- **LocalStorage**: Stores user credentials locally in the browser.
- **Form Validation**: Ensures that user inputs meet the required format and constraints.
- **Responsive Design**: Provides a user-friendly interface that adjusts to various screen sizes.
